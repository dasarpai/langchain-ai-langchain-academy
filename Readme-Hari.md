## Understanding syntext
IFS= read -r line

IFS=: This sets the Internal Field Separator (IFS) 
to an empty value for this command. Normally, 
IFS determines how Bash splits words during variable expansion. 
By setting IFS to empty, we ensure read does not trim leading/trailing 
whitespace or split the line on spaces or tabs.

read -r line:

read is used to read one line of input at a time.
-r prevents read from interpreting backslashes (\) as escape characters, 
which ensures that backslashes are read literally.
line is the variable that stores the current line from the .env file.

|| [ -n "$line" ]:

|| is a logical OR operator.
[ -n "$line" ] is a condition that checks if line is non-empty (-n means "non-zero length").
This part ensures the loop doesnâ€™t terminate 
if the last line in the .env file lacks a newline character 
(which read could interpret as an end-of-file condition without reading the last line).

$(echo "$line" | cut -d '=' -f 1): 
Extracts the variable name by splitting line on = and taking the first field.

$(echo "$line" | cut -d '=' -f 2-): 
Extracts the variable value by taking everything after the first =.
